<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to `iris`. 

## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of palmerpenguins from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```
-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("allisonhorst/palmerpenguins")
```

## About the data

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). 

**Thank you** to Dr. Gorman, Palmer Station LTER and the LTER Network! Special thanks to Marty Downs (Director, LTER Network Office) for help regarding the data license & use.

## Example

There are two datasets. One is called `penguins`, and is a simplified version of the raw data. All column names are in snake case to make them easier to work with, see `?penguins` for more info: 

```{r example}
library(palmerpenguins)
glimpse(penguins)
penguins %>% 
  count(species)
```

The second dataset is `penguins_raw`, and contains all the variables and original names as downloaded. See `?penguins_raw` for more info.

Penguins are fun to visualize! For example:

```{r mass-flipper, echo = FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.retina=2}
library(tidyverse)
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.7),
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = NA),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")

mass_flipper
```

### Meet the Palmer penguins

### What are culmen length & depth? 

The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak" (definition from Oxford Languages). 

For this penguin data, the culmen length and culmen depth are measured as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying!):
