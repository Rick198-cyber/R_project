The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data
exploration & visualization, as an alternative to `iris`.

## Installation

<!--You can install the released version of palmerpenguins from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```
-->

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("allisonhorst/palmerpenguins")
```

## About the data

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen
Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a
member of the [Long Term Ecological Research
Network](https://lternet.edu/).

## Example

There are two datasets. One is called `penguins`, and is a simplified
version of the raw data. All column names are in snake case to make them
easier to work with, see `?penguins` for more info:

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)
glimpse(penguins)
#> Rows: 344
#> Columns: 7
#> $ species           <fct> Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Ade…
#> $ island            <fct> Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgers…
#> $ bill_length_mm    <dbl> 39.1, 39.5, 40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1,…
#> $ bill_depth_mm     <dbl> 18.7, 17.4, 18.0, NA, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1,…
#> $ flipper_length_mm <int> 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 18…
#> $ body_mass_g       <int> 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475,…
#> $ sex               <fct> male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, mal…
penguins %>% 
  count(species)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   species       n
#>   <fct>     <int>
#> 1 Adelie      152
#> 2 Chinstrap    68
#> 3 Gentoo      124
```

The second dataset is `penguins_raw`, and contains all the variables and
original names as downloaded. See `?penguins_raw` for more info.

Penguins are fun to visualize\! For example:

    #> Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

### What are culmen length & depth?

The culmen is the upper ridge of a bird’s bill. In the simplified
`penguins` data, culmen length and depth are renamed as variables
`bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` to be more intuitive.

For this penguin data, the culmen (bill) length and depth are measured
as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying\!):
